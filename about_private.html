	<p>I graduated in 2014 from UNC-Chapel Hill where I majored in Math and minored in Religious Studies.  During my time as a student I worked an instructor at the local Mathenasium center, and participated in a summer research internship at NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center
	<br><br>
Immediately afterwards I spent three months riding a bicycle across the United States with the organization Bike & Build. Bicycling is a lovely way to become familiar with an area and since then I have bicycle toured around Texas, Austria, and Germany.
    	<br><br>
After making it to the west coast I lived in Reno, NV serving as a member of the Nevada Conservation Corps, an Americorps position building and maintaining trails and other outdoor facilities.
	<br><br>
Shortly after finishing up in Nevada I moved to Austin, TX where I worked for the Private Equity Firm, Vista Equity Partners as a Database Analyst for the newly established Buisness Development Team.  During this time I was also involved in the local bicycle community and volunteered regularly as a shop-coordinator at the Austin Yellow Bike Project.
	<br><br>
Currently I am a Graduate Student in the Mathematics Department at NC State University.  When I am able to I also try to volunteer with the Raleigh Community Kickstand, Raleigh's community bicycle cooperative.</p>
