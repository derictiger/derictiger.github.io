    <p>I attended undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill where I majored in Math and minored in Religious Studies.  During my time as a student I worked an instructor at the local Mathenasium center, and was able participated in a summer internship at NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center.  I graduated in 2014</p>
    <p>Immediately afterwards I spent three months riding a bicycle across the country with the organization Bike & Build.  Our route started in Charleston, SC and ended in Santa Cruz, CA. Bicycling is a lovely way to become familiar with an area and since then I have bicycle toured around parts of Texas as well as Austria and Germany.</p>
    <p>After making it to the west coast I lived in Reno, NV serving as a member of the Nevada Conservation Corps, an Americorps position building and maintaining trails and other outdoor facilities.</p>
    <p>Shortly after finishing up in Nevada I moved to Austin, TX where I worked for the Private Equity Firm, Vista Equity Partners as a Database Analyst for the newly established Buisness Development Team.  During this time I was also involved in the local bicycle community and volunteered regularly as a shop-coordinator at the Austin Yellow Bike Project.</p>
    <p>Currently I am a Graduate Student in the Mathematics Department at NC State University.  When I am able to I also try to volunteer with the Raleigh Community Kickstand, Raleigh's community bicycle cooperative.</p>
    <p>I also have a cat, her name is Marceline.<img src="images/marcy.jpg" alt="my cat" style="float:right ;max-width:30%;height:auto; margin: 5px 0px 5px 10px"></p>
