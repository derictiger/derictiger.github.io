Things to do to make portfolio better:

Is portfolio a good name for that page?  Maybe professional documents?  Don't want to make the nav bar too bloated on any one item
----- No, it's bad, put things where they're expected and add CV to navbar

Double check that every page works as it should

Add pictures where appropriate

Make sure statements are on brand with the website

Include evidence of teaching - embedded youtube video

Pictures of me teaching
--ouch

Caption images on ncndcis page

Add dates to publications

Some pages could benefit from changes in alignment

Student Evaluations -
  Which to include?
  Recitations & Instructor or just 2nd?
  Just numbers to compare with departmental average or the free response as well? 
  What about the inappropriate one?
  What is the context for them?
